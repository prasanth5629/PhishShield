## 📌 Overview

Phishing attacks have become a significant cybersecurity threat, tricking users into revealing sensitive information. This project utilizes BERT-based models (DistilBERT & TinyBERT) for phishing email classification, helping to distinguish between phishing and legitimate emails with high accuracy.

## 🚀 Features

- **✔️ Fine-tuned BERT, DistilBERT, and TinyBERT for email classification**
- **✔️ Preprocessing using NLP techniques (tokenization, stopword removal, etc.)**
- **✔️ Model evaluation with Precision, Recall, and F1-score**
- **✔️ Model compression techniques for improved efficiency**
- **✔️ Scalable & deployable as a real-world phishing detection tool**
